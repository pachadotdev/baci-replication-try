# baci-replication-try

Here I have tried, under a reverse engineering approach, the results from [BACI: International Trade Database at the Product-Level. The 1994-2007 Version](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/fr/publications/wp/abstract.asp?NoDoc=2726).

The file https://github.com/pachadotdev/baci-replication-try/blob/main/replication-baci-table.xlsx shows that I was able to come to very similar results after using some imagination for dtaa cleaning steps that are not explicit in the article.

I have tried to explain every step in my codes, by adding inline comments to detail the why and when of every decision in the data cleaning steps.
